Flipflop aims to be a _lightweight_ serial __boot__loader for PIC(L)F1919x
devices. +
Basic functionality is implemented to the point where it is relatively stable
at baud rates ranging from 300 to 460k over both 2-wire and 1-wire UART.

Flipflop resides in a section of memory at the beginning of Program Flash
Memory (PFM). This means the Reset (0x0) and Interrupt (0x4) vectors normally
used by an application are taken up by the bootloader. +
The bootloader does not use interrupts so the hardware Interrupt vector is
mapped to simply jump to the application's Interrupt vector. +
The Reset vector is used for all bootloader functionality. This means a
Reset is needed to enter the bootloader. On startup the bootloader decides
whether to start the bootloader or jump to the application.

== Using flipflop
Upon any Reset event, the bootloader samples the state of the RX pin. If RX is
low, the bootloader jumps to the application's reset vector. If RX is high, the
bootloader blocks and waits for the start character. The start character is
ascii character 'U' or 0x55. This character is also used to sync to the
baudrate of the UART connection, so most common baudrates 300-115.2k will work.
After successful reception of a "K" byte, this means the bootloader has synced
to our baudrate and entered "programming mode." +
Now a simple command set is presented over UART that provides basic
read/write/erase functionality.

=== Uploading to flipflop
// 1. *flipr.py* -- A simple python script is included in the scripts directory
// that will decode a hex file and send it's data to a flipflop bootloader. To use
// this script, you must compile with the flag `-mdownload` to force hex records
// to be exactly 16 bytes in length.

1. *picchick* -- A python cli tool to program PICs. Currently the
    https://github.com/rex--/picchick[flipflop branch] is the version that works
    with this bootloader.


== Building Applications for flipflop
Applications built with the xc8 compiler need minimal changes to be compatible
with the flipflop bootloader. The only change needed for most is in the linking
step, where we need to set the application to be linked with a fixed memory
offset. This can be done with the xc8-cc command line option
`-mcodeoffset=<offset>`. +
#The current offset is 0x400#

=== Restrictions
Some restrictions apply to which configuration words are accessible by the
application. Currently, Config Word 4 (0x800A) and Config Word 5 (0x800B)
should not be defined in you project. However, if these memory locations do end
up in the final hex file and are sent to the bootloader for writing, they will
be discarded. This prevents the bootloader from accidentally bricking the PIC
by disabling LVP (I have no HVP).
